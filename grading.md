## Misc

 * Plan your 40 working hours any way you like on the five weekdays. You are strongly encouraged to spend 8
   hours per day (which includes lunch!) at exactly the same timespan each workday (e.g. 9:00-17:00). 
   Deviations should be the exception, not the rule
 * No higher grade for working more hours. Please spend the time you work well, please spend you free time
   as such, only continue working when you feel like it
 * Day off: FR April 27 (Koningsdag), ?TH May 10 (Hemelvaart), MO May 21 (Tweede Pinksterdag). You are strongly
   encouraged to not work on those days
 * Try not to worry when you don't get it the first read/try. It is expected you are human, thus imperfect.
   Do signal your progress honestly
 * No higher grade for visiting Giacomondays, although it will make the project feel more enjoyable
