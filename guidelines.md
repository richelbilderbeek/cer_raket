# Supervisor guidelines

From Rampal Etienne:

 1. [ ] Be clear on your expectations. 

   - [ ] [planned for Thursday] Make a timetable with the students on when what should be done.
   - [ ] [discussed] Students sometimes complain about supervisor availability. Make clear when you are available for the students (what time, how many hours per week etc).
   - [ ] [Keep reminding students] Supervisors often complain that students do not put their research in a broader context; so be clear on this from the start.
 
 2. [ ] [agreed to plan] Provide feedback on poster and presentations
 
   - [ ] [agreed to plan] Ideally let them practise with you as audience
 
 3. [x] If there are any issues, please contact me asap.
 
 4. [x] Don't expect a lot of (statistical) skills, but there should be a willingness to learn them.
