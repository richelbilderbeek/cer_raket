Globally read all articles on nestor. Tried to install babette package but didn't get it to work yet. Familiarised myself with R a bit again.

Installed Git and used it to make this update. Installed raket and all required packages. Went through the articles again.

Did the raket vignette and ran into an error when converting the file to long form:

Error: 'to_long' is not an exported object from 'namespace:raket'
