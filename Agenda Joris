Globally read all articles on nestor. Tried to install babette package but didn't get it to work yet. Familiarised myself with R a bit again.

Installed Git and used it to make this update. Installed raket and all required packages. Went through the articles again.

Did "raket/vignettes/demo.Rmd" and ran into an error when converting the file to long form:

Error: 'to_long' is not an exported object from 'namespace:raket'

Tried to do "babette/vignettes/article.Rmd" but it gave me the message "[1] FALSE" when trying to copy the files.
