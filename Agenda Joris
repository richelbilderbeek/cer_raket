Globally read all articles on nestor. Tried to install babette package but didn't get it to work yet. Familiarised myself with R a bit again.

Installed Git and used it to make this update. Installed raket and all required packages. Went through the articles again.

Did "raket/vignettes/demo.Rmd" and ran into an error when converting the file to long form. Never mind, fixed it!
Tried to do the babette vignettes but they keep giving me an error:

Error in run(get_babette_path("anthus_aco.fas"), mcmc = mcmc) : 
  unused argument (mcmc = mcmc)

After some research I think this is because the scripts can't open BEAST or BEAUTI for some reason.
